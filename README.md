# IMPORTANT
This repository contains design files for the Apple IIe's MMU custom IC.<br />
The release candidate will soon undergo a testing phase. Until then, caveat emptor.

## Project status
The release candidate of this adapter has passed our (limited) testing so far. More tesing is needed, but so far it seems like a viable adapter.
